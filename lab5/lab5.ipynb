    "In this problem we are going to look at an inclusive search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at √ s = 13 TeV at the LHC using simulated data [A. Schuy]. The Higgs bosons are produced with large transverse momentum (pT) and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair. The Higgs candidates could be reconstructed as large-radius jets using Calorimeters. Due to large QCD backgorund containmination, the direct 5-sigma observation of this Higgs channel is not accomplished yet[Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 071802 (2018)]. We are going to use a set of training datasets to optimize event selections in order to enhance the discovery sensitivity. The optimal event selections will be applied to a selected pseudo-experiment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of you will use the same training samples for analysis. Each sample contains 14 features: ‘pt', 'eta', 'phi', 'mass', 'ee2', 'ee3', 'd2', 'angularity', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't21', 't32', 'KtDeltaR' [Eur. Phys. J. C 79 (2019) 836]. You can explore different strategies for event selection optimization using training samples. The optimal event selection will be applied to pseudo-experiment data."
